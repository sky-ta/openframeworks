# Assignment_5

## Description
Create a new project using the code from the last assignment.  

Currently emotions change over 1 second and the face is held for 1 second.  

Convert one primitive shape to a polygon. (A poly mouth could be good here.)  

Starting at each change, play a sound that you either created or downloaded (with attribution in your .md file). Make sure each sound is < 2 seconds.
